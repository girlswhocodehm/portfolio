   <h1> About Me</h1>

<p> My name is Haiying and I am sixteen years old. I joined Girls Who Code at AppNexus during the summer of 2017. While there, I made short animations and games on Scratch, I made a website (this page) and learned to code a robot.
    During my free time, I love to hang out with my friends. We love going to the city to eat and take pictures.
